# Time Dilation Simulator

This project is a web-based time dilation simulator that visualizes the effects of special relativity using Three.js and Flask. Users can adjust the velocity to see how time dilation affects the proper time and observe a 3D simulation of celestial bodies.

## Features

- **Time Dilation Calculation**: Adjust the velocity slider to see the Lorentz factor and dilated time.
- **3D Visualization**: A 3D simulation of a rotating sun and orbiting planet using Three.js.
- **Responsive Design**: The UI and 3D canvas adjust to different screen sizes.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/time-dilation-simulator.git
    cd time-dilation-simulator
    ```
    
## Dependencies

- **Flask**: Web framework for Python.
- **Three.js**: JavaScript library for 3D graphics.
- **SciPy**: Python library for scientific computing.
